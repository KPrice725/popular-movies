Udacity Android Nanodegree - Project 2: Popular Movies

## Project Overview
### Stage 1
- Implement a MovieActivity that displays a grid of movie posters, 
retrieved via the 'themoviedb.org' API.  The grid can be sorted according
to user preference, such as by popularity, rating, etc.
- Clicking a poster in the MovieActivity grid launches a DetailActivity
for that particular item, displaying additional information such as
the title, plot synopsis, user rating, release date, etc.
